Python implementation of structured joint sparse principal component analysis. This implementation is based on the `Transformer` type in `scikit-learn`.

SJSPCA can be used both for fault detection and fault isolation. For fault detection, the T2 and SPE statistic is calculated.

For details, refer to the paper published on IEEE TII: *Structured Joint Sparse Principal Component Analysis for Fault Detection and Isolation*.
